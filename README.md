Data Visualization Mini Project – Analysis of Indian Agriculture
 
 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **Indian agriculture data** using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard visualizes insights such as market price trends, production quantities, fertilizer usage, rainfall patterns, and crop distribution across different states and seasons in India.
 Objective
To create an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that helps understand:
- Agricultural trends across Indian states.
- Impact of rainfall, soil type, and season on crop production.
- Market price variations by crop and year.
- Fertilizer usage and production metrics by season.

 Dashboard Highlights
The dashboard includes the following key visuals:

1. Sum of Market Price by State (Pie Chart)** – shows state-wise price contribution.  
2. Market Price by Year (Bar & Line Chart)** – displays price trends over time.  
3. Area (in Acres) by Crop and Soil Type** – compares land usage.  
4. Fertilizer Usage by Season (Line Chart)** – tracks fertilizer count seasonally.  
5. Rainfall Analysis (Line Chart & Gauge)** – analyzes rainfall amount and its maximum value.  
6. Production Quantity and Market Price by Farmer ID** – farmer-wise productivity view.  
7. Filter Panel** – crop-based filtering (e.g., Rice, Maize, Sugarcane, Wheat, etc.).
